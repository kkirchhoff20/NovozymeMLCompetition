    "# Train Data Contains Wildtype Groups\n",
    "* Split off from @cdeotte's [excellent notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/cdeotte/train-data-contains-mutations-like-test-data)\n",
    "* Also inspired by [Train Data - 13,000 Single Point Edit Mutations!](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/novozymes-enzyme-stability-prediction/discussion/355737) discussion and notebook\n",
    "* Finally, this notebook uses the corrected training data as generated by @dschettler's [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dschettler8845/novo-esp-how-to-use-updated-training-file)\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this is an incremental improvement and even more robust way of extracting and grouping the train data. :)\n",
    "\n",
    "For my version, grouping is by any group of size MIN_GROUP_SIZE=5 or more that shares a single wildtype, such that all rows in the group are no more than a single mutation away from the wildtype.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to change, but note that currently the output is saved as separate files, the wildtype groups, and the 'no wildtype' everything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next steps:\n",
    "* It would be great to get some help from the community to generate AlphaFold PDBs (and DeepDDGs) for the largest wildtypes, and publish public dataset(s). Maybe a sign-up sheet in the comments? Because it would take a long time for just 1 person. How to [generate PDB is here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/novozymes-enzyme-stability-prediction/discussion/354982https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/novozymes-enzyme-stability-prediction/discussion/354982).\n",
    "* Since test data is single pH, single source, it is very reasonable to further subdivide into groups that are same pH, same source. This can be done for the wildtype groups AND for the 'everything else' group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even more next steps: I believe that using a 'learning to rank' algorithm on each group separately will be a better way to train, rather than some method of directly predicting the target variable.\n"
